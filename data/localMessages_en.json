    "slogan1": "The 1NANCE vision is to build several decentralized financial applications (Defi - Apps) and then develop these products into full fledged projects thereby increasing the value of the 1NANCE ecosystem. With the uproar of several decentralized financial (Defi) products not having real use cases and simple methods of use, product usage has been difficult for Defi users especially because it requires vast understanding of the Ethereum blockchain. Another common problem is the false value which many Defi projects propose by building simple swap websites and then halting further development.",
    "slogan2": "This makes it seem as though the Defi swap is all there is to offer but this is not so. The 1NANCE project and its decentralized team from different countries, promises to create a sustainable ecosystem by developing and building several Defi products around its platform and guarantees the ultimate true value of what a Defi project should be. 1NANCE is a community-driven blockchain project which aims to build severally Defi-applications on top of its platform with creative and disruptive blockchain Defi ideas, hence becoming the first cutting-edge Defi project worth emulating.",
